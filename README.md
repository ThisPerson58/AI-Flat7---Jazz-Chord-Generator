# AI-Flat7---Jazz-Chord-Generator
This project uses this data set: https://github.com/mikeoliphant/JazzStandards, to create an AI model that predicts jazz chords based on your input.

The entire program is inside the notebook, including tkinter UI.

The folder called AIFLAT7model is saved via tensorflow keras. Make sure that this folder is in the same folder as the notebook, because no path is provided.
The model has been trained using 100 epochs. I have provided a 'createmodel' subroutine where you can train your own model. It should overrite the saved model.

I recommend opening this project via jupyter notebook or google collab.

The playback may not sound the best, because I have no implimented any form of chord voicings.
